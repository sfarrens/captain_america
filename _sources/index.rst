Glass Cannon is a lightweight toolkit built on GLASS and CAMB for generating
lognormal matter fields, computing angular power spectra, and simulating
biased tracers (e.g., galaxies, HI) across redshift shells. It provides a
simple pipeline and small utilities to help prototype large-scale structure
simulations and visualisations.
